  blurb: I build ABMs of political systems. I am interested in understanding electoral politics in America. More specifically, I want to interrogate how well our electoral system represents voters preferences.

  blurb: "I build simple economic ABMs. These models are cybernetic: agents work in simple feedback loops."

  blurb: "I am interested in the emergence and dynamisms of global political structures, particularly in how individuals and small groups influence international structure---start wars, alter alliances, develop and confound established structures; anarchy and that sort of thing."

  blurb: "I work on consumption theory and models of financial markets. A major focus is learning under extensive uncertainty. I use a variety of reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, and simulation optimization methods to inject bounded (and even full) rationality into ABMs."
